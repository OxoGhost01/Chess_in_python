Hey, here is my chess game in python (this is not awesome, i'm a newbie xD)
To play, simply download the 3 .py files (main.py ; jeu.py ; pion.py) and the folder img. Don't forget to download the pygame package and run the main.py !

# This game will never be finished because my implementation is so bullshit that it's almost impossible to implement the check state
